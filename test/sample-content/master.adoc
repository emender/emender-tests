I want to provide some sample info for bad style and/or bad asciidoc. This will fail tests run via emender for using terms included in `violations.txt`.

Please keep in mind that you'll need to escape certain special characters in terms such as e.g. , i.e. , etc.

You can also call out asciidoc syntax mistakes that don't fail the parser, for example the below source blocks have typos in the options parameter:

[source,options="no-wrap"]
----
$ ./runAllTests.sh
----

or 

[source,option="nowrap"]
----
$ ./runAllTests.sh
----
